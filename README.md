Imagine you’re looking at a website I built, one that does something super cool – it takes any number, from the everyday 132 to those mind-bending scientific notations like 1.32e4, and transforms them into their full word form! So, instead of just seeing "132," it’ll say "One Hundred Thirty-Two" in proper words, with the option to ditch the dashes if that’s more your vibe. I’ve put the power of numbers into words right at your fingertips – no more boring digits, just elegance!

And here’s the best part – it even handles scientific notations like a boss. Plug in something crazy like 1.32e4, and boom! Out comes "Thirteen Thousand Two Hundred" just like that, no confusion. I’ve coded it to take on numbers till "One Hundred Duotrigintillion," because why stop at just a million, right? I mean, it’s all about taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary – I didn’t just build a website, I built something that makes math... poetic!

This Converts numbers and scientific notation to their word form.

For example, 132 becomes One Hundred Thirty-Two (dashes can be turned off)
Additionally, 1.32e4 becomes Thirteen Thousand Two Hundred
till One Hundred Duotrigintill
